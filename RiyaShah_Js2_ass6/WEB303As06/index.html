             <div class="panel">
               <p>Sometime during or after the 2011 Canadian federal election, the Conservative government there granted Canadian citizenship to Kumar by invoking a little-known law
                  which allowed circumventing the usual residency requirement for Canadian immigrants. According to a former Conservative Party minister, Tony Clement, the citizenship 
                  was awarded in return for Kumar's offer of putting his "star power to use to advance Canada-Indian relations," and Canada's "trade relations, commercial relations, 
                  in the movie sector, in the tourism sector."Although Kumar had earlier appeared in a campaign event for Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper in Brampton, Ontario,
                   a city with a large Indo-Canadian population,and praised Harper, Clement denied that the citizenship was a reward for partisan support. Kumar had received an honorary
                   doctorate degree from the University of Windsor, and in a 2010 interview with the Economist claimed he had "dual citizenship." He was one of the 15 international celebrities 
                   invited for the Olympics torch-bearer rally to Canada</p>
